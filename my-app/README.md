# Sample project made with Create React App

This is a WIP project made as showcase of some of the techniques I use in Fe development

- Creating custom components based on existing libraries

- Using typescript with React

- Using hooks

- Passing children as props

- Using createStyles to make css based on javascript objects

- Using react router

- Using responsive components based on css breakpoints

##### Upcoming work:

- Use a state management library (I currently use Redux, but I will implement Recoil on this project)

- Implement unit tests with jest

- Implement storybook

- Implement Cypress tests
