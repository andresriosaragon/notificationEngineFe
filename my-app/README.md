# Sample project made with Create React App

This is a WIP project made as showcase of some of the techniques I use in Fe development

- Using typescript with React and mixing typescript with vanilla js for parts of the application where the typing is not well understood yet. For example in the redux configuration. That way a project can progressively adopt type safety.

- Creating custom components based on existing libraries

- Using hooks

- Passing children as props

- Using createStyles to make css based on javascript objects

- Using react router

- Using responsive components based on css breakpoints

- Using redux as a state management library. I have experience with recoil and have used mobx as well

- Using json-server so I can develop before having a fully implemented api

##### Upcoming work:

- Implement unit tests with jest

- Implement storybook

- Implement Cypress tests
